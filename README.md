# Arch Linux Desktop Setup Scripts and Configs
This repo contains all of my personal Arch Linux configs for i3, polybar, etc. Running the install script in the root of the repo should install all components (requires user input during installation of various components).
## Prerequisites
You need to install the base-devel package and rust (via rustup) prior to installation.
